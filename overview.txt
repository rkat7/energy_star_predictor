This ML workflow starts from importing the datasets and the necessary modules, cleaning the data and preprocessing it, feature selection and feature engineering etc.
It also evaluates the most appropriate model to use (Gradient boosting in this case) among several models. After that, it does hyperparameter tuning.
Then improvising and interpreting the model is done.
